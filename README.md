Ruby Web Compress
===============


###Summary  

This is a simple file to remove white space, blank lines and line breaks from HTML files.

This will find each .htm or .html file in your folders and subfolders and compress them in place. Originally developed to fix output files from Octopress.

This is not true compression, but reduces file size in html by removing space.

- Makes transfers faster
- Makes files smaller on the web server
- Makes less work for gzip

Feel free to fork or improve this

###Future Plans

I plan to make this into a tool that compresses CSS and JavaScript as well, and select different levels of compression for compatibility. 

Would also like to set it up to work as a post commit hook.
